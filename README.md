# Data-Visualization
Visualization using most powerful libraries in Python.
Here you will explore how to work on the most famous library, MatplotLib.PyPlot, which is used for data visualization. Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. 
You will also see hands on experience with Seaborn. Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
We will also learn how to work with time series data. The Dataset that we will use is the stocks data for 4 companies, i.e. Apple, IBM, Cisco and our favourite Microsoft. 
However, you can find the latest stock dataset from NASDAQ's website (http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/) but I have also uploaded the csv file which contains past 10 years of data. The latest data is from May 30th 2017.
